README - H2O BLOB
Patrick Lathan, Elena Sparacio, Nathan Young <Money> 

GAME OVERVIEW:

The goal of the game is save your GrandBlob! He is freezing to death because of the climate and Blobothermia. You need to find all magical plants to save your GrandBlob. To find all the plants, you’ll have to use all your water powers - from ice, to water, to vapor. Once you find all the plants, you’ll need to place them around your GrandBlob to bring him back to life. 

The player needs to find all the magical plants without killing himself or his GrandBlob. If they complete this task, they will beat the game. Otherwise, it's not looking good for the GrandBlob...
